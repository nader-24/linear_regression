# linear_regression 

Key components of linear regression:

Dependent variable: The variable you want to predict or explain.

Independent variables: The variables used to predict the dependent variable.

Regression equation: A mathematical equation that describes the relationship between the variables. In simple linear regression, it takes the form:

y = mx + b
where:

y is the dependent variable
x is the independent variable
m is the slope of the line (representing the relationship between the variables)
b is the y-intercept (representing the value of y when x is zero)
Least squares method: A method used to find the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values of the dependent variable.

Applications of linear regression:

Predicting outcomes: Forecasting sales, predicting stock prices, estimating customer churn.
Understanding relationships: Analyzing the relationship between variables, such as the impact of education on income or the effect of advertising on sales.
Making decisions: Identifying key factors that influence outcomes and using that information to make informed decisions.
Types of linear regression:

Simple linear regression: Involves only one independent variable.
Multiple linear regression: Involves multiple independent variables.
Assumptions of linear regression:

Linearity: The relationship between the variables is linear.
Independence: The observations are independent of each other.
Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all values of the independent variable.   
Normality: The errors are normally distributed.
